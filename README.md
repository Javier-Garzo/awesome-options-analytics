# Awesome Options Analytics [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of tools, libraries, data providers, and resources for options analytics, volatility research, and derivatives trading. Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) project.

Options analytics spans a wide problem space: computing and interpreting options greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega, vanna, charm), modeling the implied volatility surface and volatility smile, calculating gamma exposure (GEX) and dealer positioning to understand market microstructure, analyzing 0DTE and intraday options flow, fitting stochastic volatility models such as Heston and SABR, and applying systematic risk and position-sizing frameworks like the Kelly Criterion. This list collects the tools, data providers, libraries, papers, and communities relevant to each of these areas.

Contributions welcome. See [Contributing](#contributing).

## Dealer Positioning and Market Microstructure

Dealer positioning analysis focuses on inferring how market makers' hedging obligations — driven by their options inventory — create predictable, measurable pressure on underlying prices. The key exposures tracked are GEX (gamma), DEX (delta), VEX (vanna), and CHEX (charm), each of which drives hedging flows under different market conditions.

## 0DTE and Intraday Options

Zero-days-to-expiration (0DTE) options — contracts expiring the same day they are traded — have grown to represent a substantial and growing share of total SPX options volume. Their short lifespan creates distinct dynamics: rapid theta decay, concentrated gamma near the money, and large intraday hedging flows that can move the underlying.

### Papers and Research

## Kelly Criterion and Position Sizing

The Kelly Criterion provides a mathematically optimal fraction of capital to allocate to a bet given an edge and a payoff distribution. Applied to options, it must account for the non-linear payoff structure, the role of implied vs realized volatility in defining edge, and the practical need for fractional Kelly to manage drawdown.

### Papers and References

## Options Screeners

### APIs and Tools

- [FlashAlpha Live Screener](https://flashalpha.com/docs/lab-api-screener) - Live options screener API. Filter/rank symbols across your universe by gamma exposure (GEX), variance risk premium (VRP), IV, greeks, harvest scores, dealer flow risk, and custom formulas.

### Screening Strategies

- **Harvestable VRP** - Filter for positive-gamma names with `vrp_regime = harvestable`, `dealer_flow_risk <= 40`, `harvest_score >= 65`. Captures short-vol setups where implied richness is durable.
- **Negative gamma alert** - Filter for `regime = negative_gamma` and `dealer_flow_risk >= 50`. Identifies names where hedging flows amplify price moves.
- **IV premium ranking** - Rank by the formula `atm_iv - rv_20d` to find names where implied is richest vs trailing realized.
- **Cascading 0DTE call seller** - Filter `expiries.days_to_expiry = 0`, `contracts.type = C`, `contracts.delta >= 0.3`, `contracts.oi >= 1000` to surface high-probability short-call candidates.
- **Risk-adjusted harvest** - Compute `harvest_score / (dealer_flow_risk + 1)` as a formula to rank setups by expected reward per unit of hedging-flow risk.
